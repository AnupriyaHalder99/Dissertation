The paper aims at studying whether the asymptotic distribution of the Mann-Whitney U statistic is Normal with specific mean and variance followed by investigating the consistency of this U Statistic. For this purpose, first I examine that, if random samples are drawn from any continuous population and the value of U-statistic is computed, it will follow a normal distribution asymptotically. Now, I draw random samples from two continuous populations and examine whether the estimate of the probability of the value of U-statistic (U) exceeding the cut off value Uα where, Uα is such that P_Ho[U ≥ Uα] = α, α being the size of the test, converges to α if the two samples are drawn from the same continuous population. It is further verified whether the above estimated probability increases to 1 if the difference between the mean of the two populations is increased. Also I obtain power curves for each case and observe that as the sample size is increased, the power curves become steeper and the test becomes more and more consistent.
